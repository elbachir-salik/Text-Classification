"Enjoyable just to stroll along beside this sandy expanse of beach, not least for the potential breeze benefits on a humid day",positive
"We desperately wanted to avoid the crowds and the further north we drove, the less busy it got. It was clean and water was superb but I preferred Pompano beach which was much wider and not so close to the street and car traffic.",positive
"Don't just stay south of Sunrise Boulevard. One of the best hotels is Sun Tower, and you don't want to miss Lauderdale By the Sea!",positive
"Fort Lauderdale: You can keep it. The beach is lacking, not very deep and certainly not very romantic. Look at great beaches around the world: this is not one of them.\nDaytona Beach is so deep and wide and walkable. Myrtle Beach the same. And the beaches in Mexico are astouding for beauty and culture. And the traffic in FTL is awful, the restraurants are overpriced and a lot of people look glum and tired.\nJust telling it as I see it.",positive

"Saw there were going to be decent waves this weekend so brought my boards to the beach for some boogie boarding. When I parked I noticed the flags was 1 red not 2 red, 2 red means water is closed to public one red means high surf, swimming is discouraged but allowed. The life guard told me I couldn't go in the water unless if I had fins which is ridiculous fins help but are not required. Don't waste your money here. I've been boogie boarding for 20 years I follow the flags rules, Im aware of how rip currents work and am mindful.",negative
"Ok, once again not going to start bad. Beach was narrow but nice and clean water nice, weather for February real nice. What ever charm was here packed up a long time ago. Almost killed on my bike. Too much traffic. Food yes. Big city with a beach.",negative
It is so sad that such a nice beach is associated with utterly disgraceful locale with so few parking.,negative
"The beach and camping resort were great.but,as a veteran truck driver, what I do say is traffic control is horrible, people are allowed to drive very aggressive and speeding,wow.that is why we will not be coming back.saftey is a joke!",negative
Beach looks really nice. Its a saturday and we been in a traffic jam for over 2 hrs. July 10th. I just think its poorly managed traffic.,negative
"Once again, traffic is a nightmare especially trying to leave the island beginning mid to late afternoon. Plan accordingly unless you want to spend an hour of your vacation trying to get to mainland.",negative
"very few places to eat other than fast food, rude locals, no shopping, heavy traffic\nwe will not go back there, we live in Mississippi and go to coast several times a year, this is one area we will never return, loved orange beach, fort Walton and destin.",negative
"Free beaches, no crowds along the 7 Mile National Park"" area. Just a short drive or bike ride away from tourist area.""",positive
We loved this beach. Quiet and gorgeous. The pier is great!! Waters can be still one day and large waves the next. Will be back,positive
"Most people turn at the Navarre Beach sign and drive straight to the beach. However, it is a long walk to the pier and a long walk to the water. If you don't want a long walk to the beach, drive a few minutes west and look for area 29, 32, or 33. We went in August. If you are looking for a relaxing , family beach, this is it!",positive
"Gorgeous beach. Navarre is beautiful and the sand is super soft. It�s a clean beach and very family friendly which is awesome. It�s also nice that there isn�t much built up around it but maybe 4 condos/ 1 hotel. The only downside was the lack of good restaurants. The food across the board was average and lots of fried food but healthy options were tough to find. This is definitely a beach only destination which is completely fine by me. I love that there aren�t beach superstores, chains everywhere next to the beach. I love that it�s more quiet than the really populated beaches like Panama City Beach, Miami, Daytona, etc. Go with Navarre or the beaches down south if you�re looking for a more relaxed spot",positive
Quiet and peaceful beach and mostly clean sand though it seemed to have more cigarette butts than the beach at Destin Florida when we visited.,positive
"This is our second time back to Navarre beach due to it�s beautiful sand and water. Unfortunately, we came after a tropical storm that stirred up a lot of algae. The water was not as clear as usual and I needed a shower afterwards to clean off all the green. Otherwise, the experience was still good. It is a family friendly atmosphere. Be sure to wear sunscreen and reapply often.",positive
"Cute place but tour is lacking. They simply give you a card that Has labels of what you are looking at in distillery. Then you sample three drinks : gin&tonic, mule, and whiskey. Sample are great and people are very friendly. They are doing their best with covid environment. It is not really a tour anymore. The restaurant next door is good.",negative
"This was our second tour of the distillery and truly disappointing. Our tour guide truly did his best, but the obnoxious people just ruined it. Yes, people touring a distillery are going to be a little rowdy. It�s fun, like a little party with some history added in. Sadly, these folks could not shut up so that a word could be heard. On our last tour, there were very thorough descriptions of how the drinks were mixed, the stories behind the mixers and a visual of the drinks being prepared with a discussion. Not so this time, who could have heard it? It was basically just pour a bunch of tiny drinks, come crushing in to get them. One young man just stood there in front of everyone handing drinks back to his crew of people and nearly got into an altercation with another man. It was largely college aged people, and some even brought small children. Okay, what 6 year old wants to tour a distillery and see barrels of bourbon? There was absolutely no consideration for other guests. The last time we visited, the unorganized, �everybody come get a drink� system worked, but when full of obnoxious, loud, I am the center of the Universe college age people, imagine how well that works. On our first visit, we bought their bourbon aged in port wine barrels, souvenirs, mixers and did exactly what the distillery wants you to do, spend a lot of money. This time we left in disgust. I certainly don�t blame the tour guide, but there should be some way to bring the unruly back in line so that the experience isn�t ruined for others. Thank goodness we have been here before, or we would certainly think this was the distillery experience at its best. Maybe they should charge a nominal fee for the tour. That might discourage the �free drink� crowd and return some of the informative experience. If people truly are there just to get the free samples, maybe have a separate tour. The system they use now is only going to work for mature adults.",negative
"Tours are free, but they fill up fast since distilleries are the new hip thing to visit. The building is historic and cool and I give props to their marketing team- they�ve really done a great job in generating interest. However, the gift shop and tasting room get packed. I thought the products were a little overpriced for what you get. I really wasn�t a fan of the rum, vodka, gin or bourbon...but their mixers were pretty cool.",negative
"You have to time the tickets right, and we missed the window so had to wait a bit. The bourbon mash in the tanks smells great, and we ended up buying a pair of the mixers they sampled. Worth a visit, especially if you get a full size cocktail and something to eat at the Ice Plant restaurant next door.",negative
"We turned up with our drivers license for id, but was told we needed to bring our passports due to 'Florida law'. We stuck with the tour which was good but were made to feel a bit stupid stuck at the back and not allowed to participate in the tasting, which involved a tiny thimble-full of cocktail. It completely ruined what would have been a good tour.\nNone of this would have been quite so bad-a law is a law, until at the end when I asked if I could still buy some bourbon with just my drivers license, that our guide told us that this so called law is up to discretion, and that I could probably buy a bottle. So basically if I was handing over thirty bucks for a half bottle then mehhhh that's fine.",negative
Went with a large group of family and friends. The gen eral concensus amongst our group was that there was not much to offer except very expensive drinks and gift shop.,negative
"I live in Pensacola and love Pensacola Beach EXCEPT for Memorial Day Weekend. The island authority promotes this as an LGBT weekend and they get lots of participation from people from all over. The problem is that the island authority values the money from these folks more than they value the family friendly atmosphere that is present on all other days of the year. During this weekend, they apparently allow topless lesbians and nude gay males to walk about freely in some areas. And when the LGBT's finally do go home, they leave their trash wherever they please. The beach is a ridiculous mess at the end of Memorial Day. The authority would not allow other people to do this, but because of the money the weekend brings in, they allow this ridiculous behavior. If you are going on vacation during the Memorial Day weekend, stay away from Pensacola Beach.",negative
After spending over an hour on the causeway trying to get to the beach we gave up the turn for the beach was also backed up figured would be nightfall before we could get to the beach. Were told was worth the trip by locals.,negative
"If you love national parks and/or beaches, go to PINS. We only went to the north end this trip (rotten weather) but have been to the south end and think it's better.",positive
"This is the Golf of Mexico, Corpus Christi\nWe took pictures during taken photos. My wife was driving.\nI liked it!\nWorthwhile to see",positive
"Nice Long Beach, with good drive on access points. Was windy and cool when we were there but still had a nice relaxing day there.",positive
"This is a beautiful beach area out from the commercial area. It has great views and the visitor's center has nice picnic tables and a viewing deck. The facilities are not as nice, but there are changing rooms, showers and bathrooms. If you want to spend more than about an hour and a half here, I would recommend packing a cooler and a tent or umbrella to create some shade. When I went on a Friday, the beach was pretty busy, but walking a little bit to one side created some space and was much nicer. I would go here again for the views and the lovely beach area, but I would definitely want to be more prepared next time!",positive
Gorgeous beach but covered with trash. We drove 15 miles down and there was still trash everywhere that looked like it had been there for quite a while. I would definitely come back but it was very sad to see the state of the exquisite piece of landscape.,positive
"The view of the shore before every inch was build on. There is a stretch of continues 60 miles of drive-able beach preferably with 4WD vehicle. Part of the beach in front of visitor center is closed for vehicular traffic, offering quiet way to explore this beautiful area.",positive
This is a disgusting beach. Dirty diapers and empty bottles of beer. The staff is rude and does not speak English,negative
Major delay to read Seashore. Nature trail access was blocked by road work. Might be great when done but suggest avoiding until it is finished.,negative
Twice we drove all the way down to the coast and bought hotel rooms for multiple nights hoping to see one of the turtle releases and twice the National Seashore underachieved.\nThe beach is beautiful however I am incredibly disappointed in the turtle release program they have! They state on their website to plan your trip around the time the most turtles are expected to hatch.\nMy family and I went down to the coast to watch the turtles hatch.... Well you can imagine our disappointment when no public releases happened.\nWe later found out that the turtles did hatch they simply didn�t want to host a PUBLIC release even though we planned for the dates that coincided with the release dates on their website.,negative
"There is a lot of trash on the beach right now. We tried to walk down the beach but we just couldn't ignore the garbage and left after about ten minutes. It's no fault of the park service. It's just sad that there's so much pollution. Some people didn't seem to mind the trash, though. There is a ten dollar entrance fee. The park website says that the trash situation is better at different times if the year. The drive out there is very pretty and scenic with nice dunes.",negative
RV camped here with 2yr and 8 yr olds. Very nice bath house. RV spot was no nonsense with a pergola over a picnic table and a grill out in the sun. Too hot to grill. When they say the RV spots are just behind the sand dunes from the beach they mean half a mile or so walk to the beach. There are a few picnic tables with pergolas on the beach. This part of the gulf gets sea grasses and other things washed up on shore and the water is pretty murky.,negative
So...as you drive from Port Aransas there are barriers to keep you from the ocean.It is after\nabout a mile that those barriers go away and then the surf is about 100 yards away..As you drive\n4...5..6 miles you get closer to the waves and as you get within range of Padre Island Seashore\nthe break is very close...This is very cool and raw....The water can have a turquoise color to it but\nyou are not scuba diving anywhere around here,negative
"The beach seen here is not like the beaches of the Pacific Ocean or Caribbean. The water is from the Gulf of Mexico and is often muddy with smaller waves. It is still the ocean and a great place to enjoy being outdoors, I just wouldn�t travel over 500 miles to it as a destination of choice.",negative
"Easter Sunday, was not very busy here. Not a whole lot to do. All attractions were a couple of miles away from the beach. Do stop by the pier& walk out on it, for $2.",negative
Heaven on Earth! I love it here. My fam would prob give it 4 stars for no shade except at the picnic tables when you walk in near the lifeguard tower but I love this beach. Long 2 miles of beautiful and wide white sandy beach. Sandy bottom and great to cool off relax and float. Great places where there was calm and places for boogie boards or learning how to surf. The backdrop cannot be compared and it is truly breathtaking. They were redoing the bathrooms when we visited so just port a potties. 2 showers. 10 min walk to shops and restaurants if you�re near the middle of the beach. We wished you could rent SUPs on the beach but I think they�re near the street rather than beach front?,positive
We stopped by Hanalei Bay to watch the sunset after dinner. It was very nice. Quite a few others had the same idea. It was a relaxing way to end the day and the sunset was gorgeous.,positive
"The town of Hanalei and the adjacent bay are very pretty but crowded and expensive. Difficult to find parking in town and at the beach parking lots. The beach is crowded and the surf is very inconsistent and is either too big and closing out or too small. Everything is very expensive even for Hawaii. People, especially the locals are rude and arrogant. It also rains a lot and there is no night life. Do not recommend coming here. Your money is better spent elsewhere.",negative
"This is one of Kauai�s best beaches. Excellent swimming, surfing, picnic spot and volley ball. However, even in paradise you find some glitches and this one is becoming largely overwhelmed with too many people and not enough oversight or upkeep. If the city of Hanalei wants to keep this area viable it needs to fix gates, get the dogs out (as posted) stop the extremely loud music and pay attention to one of the loveliest spots on Kauai",negative
"Probably the most beautiful beach setting in the world. However, people, perhaps locals, let their dogs run wild. Our little part of the beach off of He'e street (Waioli Beach Park) reeked of dog urine and feces. Watched a black lab do its business at waters edge and then it got washed into the surf. Needless to say we didn't go in the water after that. We have been coming to beautiful Hanalei Bay since 2001. Words cannot express our dismay.",negative
"Because of floods in April are still all prime locations in North closed(road damage) resp. Open just for residents.\n- Tunnels beach, Ke�e beach\n- Kalalau trial\nBcs of road closure i tried to go there on rental kayak, but they told me that Tunnels beach is open just for locals and i can�t use kayak for it. Also heared that�s locals don�t want to open The road for public, just shuttles. If it�s true, it�s really good idea how to kill turism in North shore of Kauai.",negative
A must visit place when in the area. Just be aware that restrooms at most visitor places don�t open until after Easter!,positive
"Summer may be over, but this October has been warm. So why not take a day trip to the beach. That is exactly what we did. Race Point Beach was just beautiful and the surrounding dunes were just breathtaking. There was even a wedding being held on the afternoon we visited. I would love to go back in the Spring time and hike the dunes.",positive
"The water is clean and beautiful, but the sandy areas are filled with large rocks. It�s not crowded at all, it�s a very nice place to relax and sun bathe.",positive
We visited this ~ 7 mile long beach today after passing the unoccupied fee hut. The misting fog kept beachgoers away but there were several tourists like us wanting to see the flowers among the endless dunes of the Cape Cod National Seashore. The restrooms were open and blue vinyl pathways extended to the beach and the US Lifesaving Station. Now onto the Pilgrim First Landing Park and their 252� Monument,positive
Winter is not the best time to go to the beach in Massachusetts but for a peaceful ride without traffic this is a great place to go.,positive
Sandy beach. Parts of the beach are blocked for scientific/nature studies. Long walk from parking lot to the beach. Boiling hot sand. Make sure you were water shoes or shoes other than flip flops. Your feet will burn otherwise.,positive
"Ummmmm I�m confused. 5 stars compared to what? I�ve been on almost all of the Cape Cod beaches and this one is near the middle of the list, not anywhere near the top. Go to Marconi or Head of the Meadow. Breathtaking. Not this one. Unless you like o-K beaches with biting flies and RV Campers parked nearby...? LOL. 5 stars...OK.",negative
The winter storms destroyed 2/3 of the parking. Good luck with that. This summer access will be a nightmare unless you arrive by bicycle.,negative
"Oh my gosh, it was rainy very windy. We walked down to water and was trying to hurry and get back to vehicle. Thought I was going to die because I couldn't catch my breathe. Scares the crap out of me.",negative
What constitutes a 'beautiful' beach?\nAll the adjectives I can think of certainly wouldn't describe this one.\nIt certainly hasn't got good dog owners or beach police as I found old dog poo on the sand!!!,negative
"Sorry, not a beach person so I'm not a good one to review a beach. Sand everywhere. Try the pools at the hotels and get a drink on your chaise as well.",negative
We only stayed an hour. We were forced to leave because of the horseflies-and some other flying insects. They gave us no peace-and literally dived under our umbrella-straight for our faces. We also got a lot of bites. It was sad because it really is a pretty beach.,negative
Wanted to go there on a rainy day in May to take a walk on the beach. However... still 20 USD entrance fee. Absolute rip off. Not justified.,negative
first you have to walk at lest a quarter of a mile to even get to the beach did i mention it had no covered walk way. you had to track through the sand carrying all your stuff witch sucked. The beach is nothing but rocks can't go in with out water shoes then the tide is very powerful . not a beach for children or adult because the black flies bite you like crazy. i am avid beach lover and been to many beaches but never again to this one.,negative
"We love the big beaches in Wildwood. They are clean, friendly, dogs can hang out, and plenty of room to play games. We love this place.",positive
Been coming since I was a baby. Have brought my own babies now College Students and no one is ever disappointed. The good parts stayed and anything that has changed has changed for the better,positive
"This beach is really nice. Clean and pretty; lots of clean sand, not overly crowded. Nice waves. Much to recommend it.",positive
Wildwood beach may not be the largest Jersey Shore beach it�s by far the widest so there�s always plenty of space for everyone when it gets crowded during Summer season. It�s well maintained and clean and there�s a bunch of fun stuff to do at the boardwalk. One of the best beaches of the Jersey Shore!,positive
the beach was clean. we brought our Golden to the part that was dog friendly. He did not care for the waves and would not go very far in but i still had a nice time.,positive
"It was busy but not too busy. The water was a little cold but plenty of people were enjoying boating, boogie boarding, etc. Groups were able to spread out (it was a weekday). We stayed at a motel very close. There was some parking but it is best to walk if you can.",positive
"Wildwood is dirty, overcrowded and in the last couple years has been full of punk kids starting trouble and robbing kids. Been going for 30 years and never felt it was unsafe. Places are closing now, the workers are rude, cops are rent a cops who have something to prove. They will pull you over �just because�\nThere are a couple good restaurants left but very high prices. Rentals are outrageous",negative
"Tramcar only ran until 9:30. Left us stranded at other end . Advertising until 11pm . Contacted Manager, no help. Responses was OK. Spent a lot of money buying book of 25 tickets. Another wasted time. Handicap so walk back, was a nightmare. Wildwood use to be family. Stay away,worst ever. I have been going since 1978. Never had a bad time. Things changed.",negative
Yes Beach is free and clean but it is also about 700' from Broadwalk. 400' part way on small broadwalk then 300' of sand. Got parking ticket in middle of nite.,negative
There were rules that said no ball play anywhere other than behind the crowd. Also no skim boarding at all. There�s no reason to have these rules.,negative
"Beach was fair BUT don�t look too closely. Cigarette butts are noticed and disgusting! Some people have the nerve to just leave their debris and walk off! Someone left a dirty blanket right on the beach instead of carrying to a nearby trash can which are many. In the age of COVID, many groups did not comply with social distancing.\nPreferred beach to bacteria frappe at the motel. Wouldn�t enter that pool for money.\nWildwood has changed drastically from 50, 40 even 30 years ago. It used to be a great vacation spot . Undesirables are there. Boardwalk is a filthy place of cheap stores and trashy places to eat. Stay away. High prices for mediocre Everything.",negative
"Wonderful place to swim and sun. Long strand, great views. Lots of surfers, families and dogs (seasonally).",positive
"Great walk from our Inn, beautiful sand and water. I believe parking is $30, however when you walk it�s free.",positive
"My wife and I enjoyed a short walk along the water's edge on Good Harbor Beach. The beach is scheduled to close 1 Nov 21, so we were glad to have the opportunity to visit it. Despite an invigorating breeze off the water, there were quite a few people on the beach, as well as more than a dozen folks surfing. We can see that this would be an extremely busy venue during the warmer summer months.",positive
"Amazing Cape Ann beach! This was our favorite beach out of several in the area. My kids loved the waves. Very clean abc family-friendly. Arrive early in order to park ($30 weekday and $35 weekends). Only downsides - LOTS of seagulls who literally steal food out of your hands, and a parking lot that could use some attention.",positive
"Came here in the fall just to walk around and enjoy the view and I loved it! The waves were pretty big for the Atlantic Ocean and I saw people surfing. The view was amazing. The sand was white and pristine. My only complaint is that the sign before the beach explicitly said no animals, but tons of people had dogs who were defecating on the beach and not picking it up :( but overall would visit again!",positive
"Great beach in New England. Very clean, water is clear and cool perfect for a hot summer day, fine white sand, the place is big enough to keep distance from people, nice place to have a long walk or run.\nPlenty of space for parking- parking fee is a rip off $30; no place to shower or rinse; watch out for the gulls they�ll attack your food??",positive
Someone please explain to me why the rangers �hanging out� at the walkway aren�t masked?? One approached my family today (we were wearing them). Then he proceeded to walk past my daughter still talking (unmasked). Model better. Do better. Be safer. Enforce healthy beach numbers or guidelines.,negative
"Great beach but the parking has become a big problem. Before, you would pay the $20 and be able to park in their lot. However, now they have made it a resident parking lot only. There is no other place to park besides this lot. Rude.",negative
The parking was difficult and overpriced. The distance to the beach and other visitors made for an unfavorable visit.,negative
"Public access to this beach is limited to renting a place near the beach, walking over one mile from free/cheap parking or paying $20/day at the public lot. It seems that this is one of the few sandy beaches in the area and it attracts a LOT of people. If you want to simply walk the beach, you'll have to walk over a mile just to get here.",negative
"Unless you�re staying within walking distance, access to the beach is restricted to a paid parking lot at the rate of $25 on weekdays / $30 on weekends. Apparently the lots fill to capacity quickly too. As a recent visitor to the area who really only wanted to spend an hour or so walking on the beach, the only option we could find was a drive by, which included the lousy feeling of being stuck traffic. Disappointing.",negative
"The beach may be clean, but it's small, crowded, and rocky. Parking was tight but there were spaces available. The rocks all over the place made it uncomfortable to walk on - based on beaches in California, Miami, Puerto Rico, and other places, I would not call this a beach worth traveling a long distance for, but if it's the closest option I'd say it's acceptable.",negative
"too many people, i live here and have my own resident sticker. all those out of towners pay 25 dollars a day and if gloucester raised it to 50 dollars a day theyd ;rbably still pya it, becasue they come with loades of family ad then it costs 10 dollars each for a fullday. others park soewhat nearby or wlkaling a long distance and schlepp thier coolers umbrellas babies and baby strollers and other such stuff to get there....\nlove it when the seasons over. or a rainy day or mist....\ngreedy cause i live here.",negative
if you are planning to go to the beach don't go to good harbor beach!if it's a nice beach day unless you are there by 8 am you will not find parking.parking is limited to the public but there is plenty for the residence. same goes for rockport beaches! if you go to good hardbor beach and the lot is full they will tell you to go to long beach witch is nothing spectacular to say the least. if you go to to long beach and it's high tide you will be forced out of the beach cause there is a wall!besides that the water is murky and the sand is gross. but don't despair just turn around and head for wingersheek which is not too far from long beach still in gloucester and the water is perfect kinda cold but crystal clear and most important there is plenty of parking (with a 25 $ fee)....so much for exploring new beaches,negative
"White sand, clear water, what more can you ask for!! It�s gorgeous. We arrived early, 10:00am, and parking was $30. We walked way out on the sandbars and it�s simply beautiful. Lots of great pictures to be taken!!",positive
"This is definitely a beautiful, white sand beach with WARM water which was crystal clear and no waves. There is no choice except to use the parking lot there which as of this date was $30 cash only. They do provide clean restrooms.",positive
"Beautifully clear shallow water. You can wade at least 100 yards into the ocean on smooth sand. You can see some live sand dollars, hermit crabs, and even some fish.\nThere are rocks, guards, and a small snack bar with toilets and a shower. There was also a stand selling water ice and sand toys.\nI wish I�d known about this beach when my kids were younger. It was a wonderful morning and my husband�s favorite beach since the Caribbean.",positive
Beautiful beach for little ones. Just watch the tides. Not much room at high tide. It�s always a shame that people don�t pay attention to signs posted. No dogs allowed and the state has a large sign posted at the entrance.,positive
I tend to avoid Wingaersheek in July and August. The road in there is long and twisty and the beach itself can be very crowded. If you can ride a bicycle in or go after 4PM you're better off. They have bathrooms and a snack bar and a capable lifeguard staff. There are lots of rocky areas to explore at low tide so kids like it. The water is warmer here than at Good Harbor because it's not dead on the ocean. Nice and warm at low tide when the heat of the sun gets to the shallower water. Actually it's nice here any time of year so consider early Fall or late Spring. I like to get as bare as possible and that's impossible in mid-summer but on warm pre and post summer days I can manage bare bosom lying down and a thong bikini walking around. I bring my own food but definitely bring water or other drinks. The snack bar is expensive and not particularly healthy stuff. Greenhead flies arrive about July 10 and stay till August 10 and they can ruin your day. I'd look into Good Harbor instead.,positive
"This is a beautiful beach, but for $30 to park I would expect better facilities! There was trash floating in the water. The bathrooms were so dirty, some of the toilets were plugged. Toilet paper all over the floor. Only two outdoor showers with cold water, those were also dirty. I usually come here a couple times a year but I don�t think I�ll be back!",negative
"Parking lot was full when my family arrived around 2pm on July the 3rd. I asked if I could drop off my family at the entrance before I could turn around to find a place to park outside the beach area, the guard said no without giving any explanation. Throughout my conversation with the guard at the entrance, he was agitated and rude to us. What is the point of not letting people walk in when the parking lot is full? Even if you have to turn people back, can't you at least find some decent people to do the job? My family have been going to Wingaersheek beach 3~4 times a year for the past 10 years as the kids love the place, but we have never seen anything like this before.",negative
"We weren't planning to spend the day and just wanted to walk the beach and take pics, but for $25 we nixed the plan and went to Jones River Salt Marshes Beach instead. If you coming in from Atlantic St. Jones Marsh is 0.2 miles before Wingaersheek Beach and there is no cost to park there. There is a big sign and you would take a right onto a dirt road about 0.1 to the parking area. This is a good alternative for those who don't want to spend $25 for parking.",negative
"wingarsheek had the nastiest, rudest, parking attendants and i decided i would not pay $20 to be insulted. it is a beautiful beach (i have been there many times off season and tried to vist during july and was turned completely off by the parking lot attendants. i ended up at good harbor beach where the attendants were clean, respectful and friendly.",negative
Don�t go to this beach..it�s For Residents only! We drove 45 minutes to this beach to be then turned away!,negative
"Very disappointed as when I arrived after driving for a while on the narrow winding road leading to the beach found out there was a $25 charge for parking, This was the beginning of June and there were hardly any cars there, I explained I would only be there for about an hour but rules are rules""""",negative
This is a nice park. The beach area is limited because the dunes make cliffs which limit the beach area. The sunsets are pretty. It is free to enter if you walk or bicycle in which is nice.,positive
"Such a great beach. Clean and uncrowded. I love that the restrooms are centrally located and easily accessible. One of the great benefits to this beach is that there are a few trees along the edge of the parking lot, giving lovely shade to the hot sand. A resource officer made the rounds regularly and kept things under control. All in all, a great experience.",positive
"Went with the girls for the last day of summer break. Remembered driving up here with my wife when we were students at Notre Dame many years ago. It was just as I remembered and we created new fond memories with our three little girls. Easy parking, great sand, very clean, nice facilities. Also, there was a shaved ice truck, which was a special bonus.",positive
"Any day at the lake is a great day, but Weko Beach brings something to the table that others don�t. There is a certain atmosphere , a certain festive vibe, a certain unassuming local charm that you don�t find elsewhere. Shallow water and sand bars are great for children. As a kid, I remember thinking how cool it was when I could be so far out and still not be over my head. Grills allowed on the upper portion of the beach with places to dump the coals. Nice steep dunes are fun if want to play king of the mountain. Elevated boardwalks provide an outstanding view of Lake Michigan sunsets.",positive
Just made a quick stop to enjoy the beautiful view of Lake Michigan. It's worth a stop and it was pretty quiet.,positive
"You can camp at this beach which is a rarity for city beaches. It's just outside of town and you'll pay to enter the beach during peak season anyway, so why not just stay and camp? The beach pavilion is not always open, which is somewhat of a bummer though.",positive
Used to be the most amazing beach but Illinois and Indiana people have overrun and ruined it. Litter everywhere. People have room but decide to sit right next to you up your ___. People let their dogs run free and one went right up to the water where I was swimming and pissed into the water. Campsite prices have doubled and it's near impossible to even find an opening anymore. Can't even rent any of the huts. They get fully booked up a year in advance. Very sad. I miss you old Weko!,negative
"Bathrooms/showers are never cleaned, the floors were gross, bugs and cobwebs everywhere. Power went out to entire campground for around 4 hours on Mond, bathrooms pitch black - came back on and around 8 or 9 pm, power went out for a row of developed sites (which is what we paid for) and all the workers left for the night, no one was around to reset the circuit (electric company came out and could not help us). Very hot and humid that night. Since that was our last night (out of 5 nights), it made the lasting impression I have now.",negative

"This park is community run and the community appreciates privacy. While all are welcome (according to custom), it is nice for locals to have a place of their own. Try Kaupo, Waimanalo Beach Park, Waimanalo Bay Beach Park, or Bellows Beach Park.",negative
Beautiful stretch of beach but don't go there on the weekends. It's crazy crowded & parking is nearly impossible.,negative
"Love this shore town, been going here since I was a little girl. Always feel like I'm returning home. This town has a nice, well maintained beach, the best life guards and plenty of places to eat. It offers something for every age group.",positive
"Beautiful soft-sand beach without the major crowds of Asbury or Belmar. More family oriented vibe vs. those others. Bring your chairs, coolers, and sunscreen. Day pases are $9 or do a seaon pass for like $75. There are bathrooms and food options a short walk back up to Ocean Ave.",positive
"Belmar is a beautiful Beach and everyone knows about it. Therefore, many, many people flock there. It gets insanely crowded in the summer which makes it unpleasant for me.",positive
Visiting this beach in New Jersey was a wonderful experience. Pristine clean beaches and calm seas. We really enjoyed a day in the sun with the family and grand children.,positive
Very clean beach and numerous restaurant and bars to cross the street when a cloud comes by. Great surfing area as well,positive
"We rented a house in Old Florida Village. Great house, 4 bedrooms, across the street from the gulf, but still close, 10 min walk, for access to the beach. Restaurants close. There are great bike trail that goes all along 30A . Golf cart rentals and cruiser bike rentals close too. Nice little health food store near Blue Mountain Bakery, 1/2 mile away, which has great cinnamon rolls but sell out by 9am! Excellent ice cream, shakes and snow cones by Blue Mountain Creamery 1.5 miles down the road, easy biking on the trail. 30A does get busy, and there is no bike rail that gets you all the way to Publix. We didn�t have the best weather the week we went but did get in some beach time and the beach is awesome!",positive
"Here is a PSA about culture on the beach in general and Santa Rosa Beach in particular (the beach itself is absolutely perfect, btw!) What makes any beach less enjoyable is some people who think that everyone around them enjoys the same type of music as they do or want to listen to ANY music at the beach at all. Some of the lowest of the low in a cultural pyramid are those who bring their portable speakers to a crowded beach. Sadly, you will most likely be around such people at Santa Rosa Beach. They really dampen the experience for the rest of us who want to enjoy the sounds of the ocean and kids playing - not some country-whining and/or base-laden nonsense. Sadly, I realize that this review will not make a difference except letting me vent a bit. But just on an off chance that you are one of those people who must have their boom box, please consider that your music may be quite irritating to others - perhaps imagine that someone next to you could be playing the type of music you despise? How would that make you feel?",positive
Love the beaches on 30A. Parking is an issue if you are using public access. This requires some advance planning for sure.,positive
"We took the stairs down at the San Juan entrance as it had parking for our golf cart. We were able to carry our two chairs, umbrella and cooler in one trip. The steps while steep were east to maneuver. The beach was perfect and the waves were beautiful. This end of the beach was not as crowded.",positive
"So I consider myself to be a queso expert and this place hits it out of the park! We ordered the spicy which was just the perfect amount of heat and flavor. The salsa and chips are the best I�ve ever eaten in this area as well and I�ve been here for 30 years. Avocado Tostada was DELICIOUS. Loaded with fresh avocado! Staff awesome! Very chill and casual atmosphere. Put this place on your list folks! Welcome to Santa Rosa Beach, Macho Taco!",positive
Sandy white beaches!!! Clean and free of trash these beaches are always an amazing experience. The water is gorgeous and often times you have nice sand bars that allow you to go out further. This time around we had many manta rays swimming around which adds to the beauty. A must see!,positive
Another beautiful place to see in Kaua'i. The sheer magnificent contours of the land are just amazing. The waterfalls are an added feature to an already wonderful scenery.,positive
"The safest access and best way to explore the Napali Coast is by sea or by air. During summer months, guided kayaking trips bring you up close to soaring cathedral cliff. When conditions are right, raft tours are available to guide you to hidden sea caves and remote beaches.",positive
"We started the hike at Ke'e beach and went 2 miles stopping at the river and returning. There are many, many slippery spots and I would not recommend doing this hike if it has rained recently. There are so many wonderful views. We got there shortly after 8am and the closest parking lot was already full. By the time we returned to our car the second was full and there were cars parked along the road as we left for quite a long way.",positive
The views are amazing. The tallest seaside cliffs in the world. A refreshing change from the more arid south and west shores.,positive
Had an absolute blast on this tour. We saw spinner and bottle nosed dolphins within 20 mins of taking off. Later in the trip we saw multiple whale breeches. The views were breath taking and Drew was an incredible guide! So happy to have shared his company while exploring the na pali coast. 10/10!,positive
"It's ridiculous that they charge $12 to park. AND they had such flooding right before the gate, that there was a jam up of cars, as some of them didn't want to try going through the flooded canal. I saw a ranger pick the front end of a car that was in the flooded area. $5 parking fee would be reasonable.",negative
"I did not get to see the beach when I tried on a Saturday when driving from ragged point to Monterey bay. I was turned back because the park is full but this review is about how difficult and perhaps dangerous entering the park from HW1. First it is a very sharp turn with no easy way to see any car coming out when you turn into the park entrance. Second it is a steep decline going down after the turn. So for someone not familiar with driving on a slope, this is not a comfortable place to visit. Getting out is almost as bad if multiple cars got trapped on the way up the slope. And why the CA rangers cannot set up a lot full sign before cars getting down the slope from HW1 is beyond me? They may think it is fun going up and down the slope.",negative
"We went here hoping to see purple sand, but in reality there is very little of it. We were disappointed to see that because there was so little purple sand it looked more dirty than pretty. We did not go right after the rain so maybe we would have seen more in other circumstances, but for the long wait to get into the parking lot and the high winds that whipped our faces, we didn't find this beach worth it.",negative
"We had just left Julia Pheiffer park thinking we could have beach access and found out we couldn't. Off to Pheiffer Beach to find the beach! We waiting in a line of cars for about 10 minutes only to find out the beach access was NOT easily accessible. The Ranger told us it was about a 2 mile walk to the beach. What?! Reviews on TA said it was easy access to the beach from the parking lot. Unreal...we spent most of the day trying to find a beach and were striking out. So I would have liked to see the purple sand beaches and big rock formations to report to other travelers, but we weren't ready to drag all of our beach gear two miles.",negative
"Thought we'd try a Friday visit because we'd heard weekends were crowded. Apparently so are weekdays in summer. Took us 3 passes down Highway 1 to find the entrance. Then we were turned away because the lot was full (about 1pm). We turned around and stopped to check our map, only to have the security guard yell at us for blocking traffic! I just needed a minute to figure out our next stop. No cell signal, BTW. Make sure you have a paper map!",negative
"This is a beautiful beach and worth the 1 to 2 mile twisty single lane road to get there. It was sunny on the day we went there but in the past has been very windy so I recommend preparing for both. Might also be helpful to brush up on your DMV handbook about who has the right of way on a single lane road (answer: uphill driver). Not that it matters, people were very courteous in both directions I was very impressed.",positive
"Its a tough find, but once you are on the road, its easy to navigate down. Once you get to the beach, it's unreal! The rocks in the water and the waves hitting them are very powerful. But the peaceful beach just make it so calming. The purple sand is the top layer, but if you are lucky to get after a rain, it really pops! Really enjoyed the time we had here!",positive
Very much an intsa location! Waterfall tumbling to a sandy beach. Never seen anything like it elsewhere.,positive
Gorgeous beach and surf. Purple sand. Dogs on leash are permitted on beach. Definitely worth stopping to explore when in the Big Sur area.,positive
The beach is really nice but I�m not sure it�s worth the parking and entrance fee charges. You can visit plenty of equally nice beaches where you can get in the water (the waves are dangerous here) for free.,positive
"We read about this beach which is on the way to Hana from the west so we tried it.The parking system didn't work so we paid by phone, only to learn the locals drive in and drop off their things and then park outside by the food truck. The beach is awesome and busy at the two entries. The lifeguards warn you about the waves and how to swim in the ocean. Lots to like about the beach and the view and it isn't crowded. There were also porta-potties",positive
"One of the world�s top beaches! We were in Maui for 2 weeks over Xmas, and we spent maybe 8 total days at this beach! You just have to be so very careful to stay out of the �crash zone� of the waves - since due to the steepness of the sand they often crash in very shallow water. So you can get really hurt by lingering too shallow. They call it �break-neck beach� for a reason. Separately, it astonishes me that people are paying for parking. We parked across the street every single day and saved ourselves literally $30 a day or a total of $240. Not bad work for maybe 5 minutes walk each way?",positive
If you missed Makena beach on your visit then you missed the best beach in Maui. This beach has everything to offer and it is expansive so you don't feel crowded at all....love this place!!,positive
"At the end of the day my family wanted to snorkel in the remaining daylight so we headed to this beach. It was free to park, had great bathrooms/changing rooms and showers.The beach is small but the area to snorkel was great! My family saw turtles, a spotted ray and lots of fish in about an hour and a half. The surf was pretty calm and the sunset was gorgeous! Next time we will spend more time there.",positive
"Makena Beach is very long and wide. No problem finding beach space. Parking is a problem, very small lot so might have to park along street outside and hike in. One very good taco truck in lot. The waves were very large with big riptides. Strong swimmers only, but nice beach for lounging/sunbathing.",positive
beautiful beach - but rough waters for snorerkeling. not many fish due to the rough waters. maybe the time of the day matters- we went in mid day,positive
"$10.00 to park. Porta-potties in lot. Wide, open sandy beach. A bit of a drop off for swimming, windy in afternoon.",negative
"Makena beach is often confused with Makena Landing...especially because we were looking for Turtle Town ( which is in Makena Landing) and tried snorkeling at Makena Beach. Big mistake, the waves are very tricky and dangerous especially getting in and out of the water...I had a wave pull me back into a swirl when I was already touching sand...lost all my equipment and came out with a twisted neck, felt lucky though...so warning",negative
Miles Long white sandy beach that is very pretty to look at and photograph. The lifeguard on duty warned our group to keep the kids away from the water. No kidding the surf and ebb is crazy. The waves break right on the edge of the beach leaving no room even to get into the water without getting smashed by a breaker. I think I bruised a rib getting hit by one.,negative
We were told this was the best beach to visit. It wasn't any different from any of the other beaches. Definitely too rough to snorkel. But there had been some hurricane weather a week before so that could be the reason.,negative
"A giant wave slammed 3 of us like a log was hitting us. One of us dislocated her hip, one badly bruised his ribs, and I broke my arm in 2 places. Those 2 also whacked their heads REALLY hard. Be VERY careful here! This happened when we were about ten feet from the shoreline. We had no idea that this was nicknamed break-neck beach"" and there was no indication that it was so dangerous.""",negative
DO NOT VISIT HERE IF YOU ARE BRINGING KIDS. This is a dangerous beach because of the waves. Too big. Will never come again. The only nice thing about this is the weather patterns. It�s always sunny and breezy but not too hot or chilly. The food is disgusting. Don�t get the mini doughnuts. Gross. Don�t recommend unless sunbathing or tanning :(,negative
"We were there 30 minutes and some local broke into our car and stole our camera and lenses. The locals smile and expect their 20% tip during the day, and then steal from you at night. I would love to include a picture, but I'd have track down the loser welfare recipient that stole it.",negative
"We used to vacation in Garden City-great beach! However, we found Cherry Grove several years ago and fell in love! We have made this our new vacation spot ever since we found it! We love Cherry Grove!!",positive
Love Cherry Grove Beach my wife and I go to beach. Great place to stay! It�s a little bit quieter than Myrtle Beach area.And less congested traffic. We love to go out on the pier. Also a wonderful place to look for shells.,positive
Beach was very clean and easy to get to from our room. Also enjoyed the pier. Definitely worth going back to.,positive
"The beach itself is wide and level, but parking is problematic. Go early and avoid weekends if possible. There are a few places to get food and beverages and portable toilets.",positive
"Nice beach, a bit rocky. Sunset beach not far from this one is much nicer. Very enjoyable though for a touristy spot.",positive
What a rude encounter with two of the lifeguards next to Cherry Grove Pier! We couldn�t believe they made dismissive comments and blew us off when we asked about the water conditions!,negative
"First visit stopped in for a late dinner. Place is clean, service was good. We ordered Banging shrimp for our appetizer. Frozen fried shrimp with hot sauce????. For our main course, fish tacos an a burger an fries. The burger was paper thin an cooked black it was so hard my husband could not eat it. He sent it back. They gave us credi. The fish tacos were just okay nothing impressive about their food at all.",negative
Not a good first-impression. The local amenities may be great but the local renters (owners?) did NOT convey a family-oriented type of location. Lack of law-enforcement further solidified the impression that this is more-of a party-location. We did not have a totally quiet and relaxing time.,negative
"That beach is just at the end of the beautiful Grand Strand-many miles from Myrtle Beach-and not close to all the attractions that you go to the beach to see!! Nothing there, so I'd opt for being much closer to Myrtle where so many things are available!",negative
"No need to go here. The staff at the bait shop were rude, beach is marginal at best. All amenities for resort guests only. Much better options available.",negative
"Get rid of all the half naked drunken college kids, and teach the locals a few manners. This was perhaps the worst resort town I've ever visited.",negative
"We visited many beaches and Poipu was by far the best to snorkel and swim. Wear swim shoes to get past the rocks at the entrance, but then so many beautiful fish can be seen! You may also see Sea turtles and monk seals resting on the shore during the day, carefully watched over by volunteers who set up the ropes and signs to protect them. We stayed at a Suite Paradise condo and could walk to the beach from there. What a treat!",positive
Very large beach area with good restrooms. This is a. Ery busy beach though so get there early for a decent parking spot and location. There were two sea turtles beached on the sand that we got to see make there way to the sea. Plenty of restaurants and shaved ice nearby.,positive
" Go early in the morning to see the turtles. On overcast days they are there for longer (on an overcast morning they were out until around 8:30am). At dusk, there were also � WhiThe titles says it all. Decent swimming (a few rocks to worry about) and not to rough. Great home base Beach for our stay.le there were a lot of people, there was ample space for everyone and didn't feel crowded. You can also probably see monk seals there as well�either sleeping on shore, or playing around in the water.turtles within the waves.",positive
"This was our first time snorkeling at Poipu Beach. There were lots of fish which was great. However it's very shallow and I got some cuts from the coral. As a bonus, there was a turtle on the beach that was fun to watch.",positive
"Relatively crowded but not overly so (mid-afternoon, midweek). While we were there, two monk seals came right up onto the beach! The lifeguard had to keep warning people that they were wild animals. So cool to see!",positive
"This is a lovely beach. It is very crowded and busy though. After sunset however, green seat turtles come ashore and hangout. So cool to get to see them upclose.",positive
"We have been to Poipu beach twice. Both times it was very crowded and dirty. If you go, bring some shade, there is not much shade to be had here. Good for snorkeling if you don�t mind the crowds. There are restrooms with changing rooms that are relatively clean considering the amount of use. We heard about Anini beach on the North Shore, and liked it much better.",negative
"It�s beautiful, of course. It�s a Hawaiian beach after all. But the shallows are very rocky, paved with roughly 8� or so diameter rocks which are quite slippery too. August unfortunately brings stronger currents than usual and even in the shallows, my husband got dragged a bit, and he is a strong swimmer.",negative
"We couldn't even find a place to park, but the whole area was so jammed with people, it wasn't a spot that we would have enjoyed, anyway.",negative
"There are far better, more beautiful, and less crowded beaches on Kauai. This is probably the most popular beach on the island with visitors - but is not the best one. Unless you want to share the beach with hundreds of mainlanders, ask locals for less touristy beaches",negative
"Trusted Travel Guide, absolutely overated and overcrowded beach. For this one should not visit Kaui or Hawaii. There are better beaches up north and on Hawaii. Leave the beach to the poor animals! Best was the nearby historic site parc!",negative
"Nothing much to see, even at Lawai and waters were pretty rough even in winter, so not worth the drive.",negative
Lagoons were crystal clear and warmer than the ocean water. We had seals come in at the Aulani resort. Few locals and mostly resort guests. great views.,positive
"Very nice place, away from crowds, calm waters. Really enjoyed spending time here with family on a nice sunny day. Must visit in my opinion.",positive
Excellent Condition-Four Seasons Resort shares this Lagoon and offers its excellent service for its guest on the lagoon. Only negative is during times the public try�s to use private property of Four Seasons Resort- nuisance.,positive
"If I tell you, you might come and then it won't be our special secret place to come! We usually do the hike up Diamond Head then drive over here, park free at the public lagoon parking and then swim, snorkel, walk along the pathway and enjoy a few hours relaxing. We always see military planes doing fly overs and it is fun to count how many we will see. Snorkelling in the lagoons is great and safe for kids as it is protected. We often see Turtle or Honu as the locals call them.",positive
"Solid lagoons, has an area that is grassed (put your towels there the grass is comfortable) as well as a sand area. Decent snorkeling if you get a lagoon that is not too cloudy.",positive
"My husband and I visited lagoon # 2, which was beautiful, with clear, calm water and a sandy beach. Great area for swimming and for families with kids. I snorkeled here and there were a few fish to see, but it wasn't as good as other areas on the island. Parking can be difficult to find. Not too far from Waikiki. There are restrooms here.",positive
"The resort lagoons are nice for a family swim or just to walk along. If you are not staying at any of the resorts, there is free parking at each of the lagoons. The first three lagoons have limited parking (maybe 15-20 spots) however the fourth lagoon has lots of parking so I would just head there first. A couple of the beaches have umbrellas up from the different resorts. Beaches in Hawaii are all public so you can also use the beach even if you are not staying at their resorts...and if you have your own umbrella, that is ok as well as it is public property. At some of the resorts, there is drink and snack bars that you can purchase things from...they are along the lagoons pathway so you don't need to go into a resort to get anything. The snorkeling in the bays would be limited as there is not too much rock or coral in the area.\nIf you are driving around the island then you should try the Gypsy Driving Guide app. Simply download the app and for only $10 it will give you a full tour around the island with history, information and tips on worthwhile stops. It runs on GPS not data so is a great way to learn as you go...who doesn�t want a tour guide right in your own car. This particular stretch of highway on the app gives you history of the resort districts and how they have slowly developed.",negative
"Ecoli was found this week, sure kept me out Of the lagoon, lots of pools,and I love the lap pool at my resort.",negative
"We recently arrived in Ko Olina and have observed available parking spaces in the lots at the lagoons at 9am and yet the (surprise to us) gate was closed -\nHave been coming to beautiful Ko Olina for 10 years and there has never been a problem parking if you get there early - very frustrating to see spaces and can't get into the lot! These gates are not working properly!\nWhen we finally got into one of the lagoons and left in the afternoon, there were 8 spaces available and yet the entrance gate was closed...\nWe are here for the month of April - now to find that even getting to the lagoons early will keep you from enjoying the beach - we are paying a lot of money to stay in beautiful Ko Olina and will now be frustrated for the month to go to the lagoons... Please fix or remove the gates! Very disappointed...",negative
Use to be better. Now the little parking for people to visit these has become pay parking. Overcrowded and water not exchanged that well. I'm sure this could be a bacteria heaven. Thought all beaches in Hawaii were public. Guess if you build it then they aren't. All ko'olina is expensive. May as well go to Waikiki and pay through the nose as here.,negative
In Hawaii we like the crystal clear waters and these man-made lagoons seem a bit stagnant and murky.\nwe chose to walk down the street to secret beach so we could have a real and beautiful beach to sekm and snorkel,negative
"Pensacola has great food, beautiful beaches, and plenty to explore beyond the beach. We enjoyed our weekend trip and look forward to heading back soon.",positive
"Easy parking (free), and easy access to beach. Sand is white and water is clear. Price of renting 2 chairs and umbrella, $25.00 for 2 hrs., $50.00 for day, is a bit high. Bayside $30.00 for day. No dog beach, but you have those who don't follow the rules! Plenty of restaurants facing the beach with good food and drinks when your ready.",positive
"Check in was easy, even given a military discount I did not expect. King room with Bayside view and balcony. Early check in granted. Room was large with king bed and small kurig with supplies. Free wifi. No smart tv so stuck watching local channels. No comforters, just a light blanket. No digital thermostat so had to guess on settings so either too hot or too cold.. No room service due to covid but texted to get clean towels, etc. Bathroom had large walk in shower but no permanent shower head, just sprayer that you had to hold to use as was at an awkward angle to shower under. The sink was pretty but not practical for rinsing anything out in. No microwave to heat up leftovers, did have a dorm size refrigerator. Staff very friendly and attentive. Land Shark Landing was closed during our stay and pool closed at 10:00 along with all food and bar services. Beach was wonderful right out the door but charge of $15 per hour for chairs a little high. We did think ahead to bring our own. Kids playing in pool had 2 inflatable boats with paddles they took over the pool and parents let them ??? Slightly disappointed in price for value.",positive
"Was expecting the clear emerald waters but got a wave filled amber ocean..it was beautiful either way we had rip tide warnings which is why the water is very angry..The sand was powdery white sand.. The area was hit with hurricane Sally a few weeks ago, but very satisfied with what we saw and came here for..",positive
Tax on everything in Pensacola beach area to take care of beach. My husband did not like this portion of our stay.,negative

"We visited Pensacola Beach in late October. We have been to a couple of other beaches at this time of year, one other on the gulf. Of the two gulf beaches, Pensacola was my least favorite.\nThe sand is beautiful; the water was a nice pretty dark green. Unfortunately, there was wind while we were there and the red flags were flying. The beach patrol was making regular trips up and down the beach chasing people out of the water. Most of them didn't even want you to WADE in the water. I understand the concern for safety but this was a little much. We were at the beach for three days and the red flags were flying for two of them. We had one day where the yellow flag was out. I even checked the national weather service surf report and it said there was a low risk, but the yellow flags still flew. The morning we left, the gulf looked more like a lake than a gulf; the yellow flag was still out.\nWe've been to numerous beaches in different locations; overall, Pensacola was one of my least favorite beaches. The point of visiting the beach is being able to actually use the beach. If I want a pool, I'll stay home. Again, I understand the need for safety and perhaps there have been a lot of problems here that I am unaware. At any rate, next time we will find another beach.",negative
"Pensacola Beach has really bright white, soft, powdery, sand, and the water is almost an emerald green color. i wouldn't say it was the clearest water i've seen on the Gulf, but average i suppose. the major drawback to Pensacola was all the jellyfish in the water! my family and I were stung several times while swimming. there wasn't very many shells on the beach either, and that's my kids favorite part of going to the beach is seeing who collects the most & the coolest shells. i really don't think we will ever return. there's nicer places to go on the Gulf than Pensacola in my opinion.",negative
Don't come here if you enjoy the beach they rate the beach as red flag on yellow flag day and the lifeguards are nitpicking people and are on power trips about putting their FEET in the water. I wish I was exaggerating. They are absolutely on power trips.,negative
